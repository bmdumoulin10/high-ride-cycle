            <h4 class='construction'>Ride With Us</h5>
            <p class='faqFont'>Our bikes fill up fast so be sure to book a bike early. Sign up for classes by clicking the Ride With Me button above. You can sign up for class a week in advance. Cancellations will be accepted up to 1 hour before a class by canceling your reservation in your account. A late cancel or no-show will result in a $10 fee.</p>

          <div class="teamPics faqContainer">
            <h4 class='construction'>How much does it cost?</h5>
              <p class='faqFont'>To see our pricing, go to our class price list or our monthly membership price list. You can buy a single class, a package of classes for a discounted price or a monthly unlimited pass. If you buy class packs, those credits never expire.  Monthly unlimited passes automatically renew each month or you can buy them on a one-off basis.  Everything can be purchased online or in the studio.</p>

            <h4 class='construction'>How early should I get to class?</h5>
            <p class='faqFont'>Arrive 15 minutes before class starts to get checked in, pick your bike, and get your bike fitted to you! You must check in no later than 5 minutes prior to the scheduled class start time or your bike will be released to the waitlist. No-shows will result in a $10 fee and be released to the waitlist.</p>
